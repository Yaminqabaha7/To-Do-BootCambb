## üì¶ How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

3. Start typing your tasks and click `Add`.

---

## üß† How It Works

- Tasks are stored in an array called `todos[]`.
- The `addTodo()` function pushes new tasks.
- The `showTodos()` function re-renders the list using `innerHTML`.
- `toggleTodo()` handles checkbox updates.
- `onDelet()` removes tasks by index.

---

## ‚ú® Customization Ideas

- Add localStorage to persist tasks
- Add due dates or categories
- Add animations or sound effects
- Use frameworks like React or Vue later
